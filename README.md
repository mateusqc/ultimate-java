=========

Ultima 4 port using LIBGDX, with a few extra story lines added in, and an auto-journal feature to 
make it easier to keep track of conversations.

Some of game engine algorithms are ported from the XU4 project on sourceforge.

The "Virtue of Humility" bonus story was ported from a previous project.
The Devil's Guard and Delve of Sorrows areas are original content.
